## Introduction to Quantum Computing and Spin Networks

A short talk I gave on a mechanics conference about the basics of quantum computing and the (theoretical) use of spin networks in connecting parts of a quantum computer.

To create the slides, handout and article use `make all`. This presentation uses **biber** for citations, which is still not part of many TeX and LaTeX distributions, so you need to install this first.
